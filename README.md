==>   USAGE

after cloning the source code run it using the Python interpreter:

python3 main.py 'argument'

the argument should be your C project path, after that, you will be asked
to input the allowed function of your project separated by a ',' character
(you can copy and paste them from the project subject)
and then press ctr+d
if the program did find a function that is not in the list and not declared 
in the C project it will display it

==>   USAGE

after cloning the source code run it using the interpreter:

python3 main.py 'argument'

switch the argument with your C project path then you will be asked
to input the allowed function of your project separated by a ',' character
(you can just copy and paste them from the project subject)
and then press ctr+d so the program will start checking
